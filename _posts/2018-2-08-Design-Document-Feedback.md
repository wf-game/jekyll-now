## Specific feedback for Warp Fighters
* The levels can be too large
* Needs to build a map thatcan support fast movement, will this lead to lots of empty space?
* Only 25% of the level flow would be ahievable 
* Focus on target audience further
  * Casual gamers? Who enjoys it more
* Make the game fully exterior
  * Differentiates warping through walls/windows (easier to tell where you can warp through)
  * Exterior Brutalist Architecture Design
    * Better represented from exterior (think modular designs)
* Try to focus more on one aspect, either puzzle platformer or enemy 
* If it's an exploration game how will you get people actually interested to explore
  * If player doesn't know what to do then they will move on, and don't just give out the answers
* Game flow should be linear
  * Don't send player back to tutorial level
* Invest early on in a level editor
