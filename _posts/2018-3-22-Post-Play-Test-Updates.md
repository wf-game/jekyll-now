We just finished writing our play testing report and will submit after revisions. Now after the feed back from play testing sessions we have 
tried to implement the changes in order to improve our game.

# Mechanics

In terms of mechanics, we have tried to implement a TPS camera that is able to rotate separately from the player. But, there are some bugs
that we have not worked out and was unable to implement with the Beta build. Not really player mechanics but we also implemented a high scores 
feature that tracks the time it takes to beat a level.

# Art

We added some nice VFX for when an enemy dies, basically a mesh explosion added with a melting effect.

# Level Design

We designed a new level for beta.

I think overall we still have a lot of bugs to work out. The main issues that we have is that some things are difficult to debug where
the issues are arising from. The game would be a bit better if we can work out the bugs and it will make the game feel smoother overall.
