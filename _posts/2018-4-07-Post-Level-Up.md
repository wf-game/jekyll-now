## LevelUp Showcase
Our game got a chance to be shown to the public audience this Wednesday. Although it ended up experiencing a severe graphical glitch, we hastily tried our best to patch it up during the show. We zoomed the camera in to make it first-person, and removed some post-processing effects that caused black edge blurs to grow.
Despite its glitch and unfinished graphical look, quite a few people still wanted to try it out after seeing it played.

## Afterthought
Having seen all the great games on display at the showcase, I definitely felt our game lacked a finished polish and would have wished we spent more time building a single coherent polished experience rather than scrapping the entire game and building it up over and over. I am still glad that we stuck it out to the end though, as the amount of coding challenges we faced made us look up and learn some many things about game development and even certain coding practices in general.
If I ever did something like this again, I would think that I try harder to make sure the entire team is on track (including myself) and that we communicate our problems more often. Concrete tasks should be laid out every week and perhaps spend more time working together with the team in person as opposed to having everyone go about their own thing and then try to patch things up last minute.
