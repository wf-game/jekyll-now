## Road to Mini-Demo 2

# Art
Main character concept art.


Enemy concept art.

# Mechanics
We have revamped the warping mechanic to produce a "warp guide" that indicates where the player will warp.
The player will have the ability to change the distance/direction of their warp.
We plan to allow for players to warp vertically as well.

# Sounds
We're looking to produce a main dungeon OST.
