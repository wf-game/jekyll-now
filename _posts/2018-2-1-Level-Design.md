## Big thanks to Bryn Davies from Ubisoft!
#### I only really recorded things applicable to Warp Fighters

## Introduction
* Think of the type of levels we see: action adventure/3d platformer
  * Could be any of a number of types of levels mentioned
* The level provides the structure for delivering our content and intent
* The key tool we have to work with are sightlines
  * In 2D this would be screen croping
* Eventually we want to creating matching between mission scripting and spatial layout

## The iterative process
* Start by gathering real world references
  * Felipe: Brutalist architecture seems like a nice direction
  * Combines the poly style we started with, the grittiness we want
  * Also evokes dystopean Soviet vibes, could lead to an interesting story
* Start by greyboxing levels, and make many (iterate)
  * Work from an initial plan
* Use good tools
  * Autodesk, 3DS max, Inkscape (2D), Unreal, Unity, World Machine

* Rational Level Design
  * Plan amount of action at points in the game
  * Try to quantify action generated by levels
  * Balance it with storytelling and learning moments
  * We can script the logic flow of the game this way

## Theory
* Flow
  * Layout
    * Make a plan early!
  * Pacing
    * Story vs Action
  * Circulation
    * Heat maps of failure points etc
* Foreshadow
  * Use it to inform the player and tell the story
* Storytelling
  * Eg. Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons
  * Don't be heavy handed here
  * OCAD peeps please help us

## Design Rules
* Make a game, not a simulation
  * We want Pete the party pirate, not Blackbeard
* Show don't tell
  * Environmental storytelling
  * Even audio is better than text
  * Use lines in the environment to direct the players gaze
    * In the environment ike splinter cell
    * In props like bioshock
* Gameplay metrics
  * I didn't really get much on this
  * really just the wall deadzone thing, but that seems more closely related to
* Player expectations
  * Use the expectations they have
  * Be heavyhanded when we go against that
    * Also avoid 'red barrels' because they're overdone

## Warp Fighters
* Watch Valve's portal videos describing design process
* Make a first level with a reductional approach to the core mechanics
* Check out the GDC vault too
