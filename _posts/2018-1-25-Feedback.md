# Creative brief feedback

## General feedback
* What makes the game interesting? Is the the art, the story, the challenge?
  * What makes people keep playing the game?
* Additional mechanics and challenges other than the core ones?
* How will we balance ease of entry for inexperienced players with challenge for skilled players

### Fast Prototyping
Do lots of it, and have a content plan early. 
Also play similar games, or at least watch gameplay

## Specific feedback for Warp Fighters
* Be wary of motion sickness with rapid movements in VR
* Use third person lagging camera, possibly with an aiming mode
* Its a risky core mechanic, don't be afraid to drop it (see fast prototyping)
* Consider Dragonball: charging energy to defeat enemies up close, power up early
* Drop FPS for 3rd person, more puzzles, less killing
  * Keep ragdoll physics
  * Similar to Portal
* See: Overwatch, Overgrowth Alpha, Sonic, Dishonored, Celeste
* Teleporting vs Physics? What is more fun
* Untextured low poly will lose sense of depth and speed
  * Add texture to show off fun movement mechanics
* Launching robot arms, warping bodyparts, other environment objects
* Everyone is doing low poly, we should try a different art direction
  * Gritty, like the music
  * Almost steampunk robot kind of thing
  * Felipe thinks Gears of War kind of style
